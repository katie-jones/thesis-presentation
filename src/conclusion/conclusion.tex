\subsection{Future Work}

\begin{frame}{Future Work}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Experimental tests
    \item Reduce number of states for prediction matrix generation
    \item Scale up to larger compressor networks
    \item Investigate convergence of non-cooperative controller
    \item Use more efficient linear algebra implementation
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Conclusions}
  DMPC can improve computational cost\\
  Non-cooperative control much better, particularly for larger systems\\
  Performance can be impacted, particularly for highly coupled systems
